# Trilha JS Developer - Pokedex
Every dev needs a Pokédex, this is mine!
It's a vanilla javascript page that shows cards with every pokémon, they're many, so there's a button to load more. 
Made during the course "Dominando o Protocolo HTTP e Integrando com a PokeAPI" from DIO Angular+Java bootcamp.
We used PokeAPI to get all the Pokémons infos.
Inspired by Saepul Nahwan UI design in Dribbble.
